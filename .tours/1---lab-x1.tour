For our proof of concept that doesn't require getting developer keys from social IdPs (e.g., Facebook or Twitter), we'll use AD FS.\n\n⏱️ **Duration** 20 minutes"

You will use these users to test the AD FS integration.\n\n1. In your VM, from your Windows toolbar, open Active Directory Users and Computers.\n\n2. On the left menu, go to `oktaice.local` > `Partners`.\n\n3. Confirm that the `Partners OU` contains six users.\n"

In a future step, we will upload this certificate to Okta. Okta will use the signing certificate during the app initiated sign-on to confirm that the SAML assertion is generated by AD FS.\n\n1. From the Windows toolbar in the VM, open `AD FS Management`\n2. On the left menu, go to `AD FS` > `Service` > `Certificates`\n3. On the `Certificates` panel, right-click the certificate under `Token-signing` and click `View Certificate`.\n4. Click the `Details` tab.\n5. Click `Copy to File`\n6. The Windows Certificate Export Wizard is launched. Follow the Wizard instructions to export the certificate using the default settings. Save the file as `adfs.cer` under the `Desktop` folder.\n7. Close the certificate pop-up and minimize the AD FS Management utility since we will use the utility later to integrate AD FS and Okta.\n8.
