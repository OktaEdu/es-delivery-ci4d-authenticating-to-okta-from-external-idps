      "description": "## Lab 8.1 Authenticate with AD FS as an External IdP\n\n🎯 **Objective** Set up AD FS as an external IdP.\n\n🎬 **Scenario** Okta Ice wants to allow customers to be able to authenticate via additional external IdPs. For our proof of concept that doesn't require getting developer keys from social IdPs (e.g., Facebook or Twitter), we'll use AD FS.\n\n⏱️ **Duration** 20 minutes"

      "description": "## Review the Partner Organizational Unit in AD\n\nThe Partner OU contains users that are not synced to Okta via Active Directory. You will use these users to test the AD FS integration.\n\n1. In your VM, from your Windows toolbar, open Active Directory Users and Computers.\n\n2. On the left menu, go to `oktaice.local` > `Partners`.\n\n3. Confirm that the `Partners OU` contains six users.\n"

In a future step, we will upload this certificate to Okta. Okta will use the signing certificate during the app initiated sign-on to confirm that the SAML assertion is generated by AD FS.\n\n1. From the Windows toolbar in the VM, open `AD FS Management`\n2. On the left menu, go to `AD FS` > `Service` > `Certificates`\n3. On the `Certificates` panel, right-click the certificate under `Token-signing` and click `View Certificate`.\n4. Click the `Details` tab.\n5. Click `Copy to File`\n6. The Windows Certificate Export Wizard is launched. Follow the Wizard instructions to export the certificate using the default settings. Save the file as `adfs.cer` under the `Desktop` folder.\n7. Close the certificate pop-up and minimize the AD FS Management utility since we will use the utility later to integrate AD FS and Okta.\n8.
