For our proof of concept that doesn't require getting developer keys from social IdPs (e.g., Facebook or Twitter), we'll use AD FS.\n\n⏱️ **Duration** 20 minutes"

You will use these users to test using AD FS as an external IdP integrated through Okta.\n\n1. In your VM, open `Active Directory Users and Computers` by clicking the ![Active Directory Users and Computers](./.tour-resources/adusersicon.png) icon in your Windows toolbar.\n\n2. On the left panel of the **Active Directory Users and Computers** window, select`oktaice.local` > `Partners`\n\nYou should see that the `Partners` organizational unit (group) contains six users. One of these users is Diane Smith. We'll be using that account to test our local AD FS configuration before moving on to configuring AD FS as an external IdP through Okta."
